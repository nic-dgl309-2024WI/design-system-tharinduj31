    <p>
      I'm a Sri Lankan who is new to Canada. I completed my bachelor's degree in
      Mechanical Engineering. After that, I worked for 2 years in building
      services. <br>
      During that time, I became interested in learning coding. So, I
      decided to change my career and become a web developer. Currently, I'm
      studying Digital Design and Development at North Island College.<br> I enjoy
      both designing and development, but I prefer development, even though it
      is challenging at the beginning. I believe it will become easier with
      lots of practice.
